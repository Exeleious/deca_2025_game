Financial- information management involves accessing, processing, maintaining, evaluating, and disseminating financial data to assist in business decision-making, as well as supporting budgeting activities and storing and protecting customer financial information. Challenges for financial-information management include inadequate information, multiple master sources of data, inaccuracies, inefficiencies, and disparate data structures. Unfortunately, many companies house their financial data in custom, task-specific software, making it difficult for others in the organization to access that data if they do not have that specialized software. Financial managers may use Microsoft Office applications to prepare reports, but they don't typically use such software for financial recordkeeping. Financial accountants, not managerial accountants, prepare financial information for use by external stakeholders.",

In this scenario, the future value is $600 and the discount rate is 3% (.03 as a decimal). The \"n\" refers to the number of compounding periods per year, and the \"t\" refers to the number of years. Because Zoe's account earns quarterly interest, \"n\" is 4. The \"t\" is 2 because she wants to buy the camera in 2 years. After inputting all this information, the equation is 600 / [1 + (.03 / 4)](4 X 2). After solving the equations in the brackets, we are left with 600 / (1.0075)8. Next, raising 1.0075 to the eighth power is the same as multiplying it by itself eight times, which equals 1.062. Then, divide the future value of $600 by 1.062 to get the quotient of $565.",

Internal directors aren't usually compensated for their work with the board, because they are often already a high-ranking executive, major shareholder, or key stakeholder. A board of directors is nominated by a nominations committee. Shareholders elect a board of directors but don't have the power to nominate. Every public company must have a board of directors. While some private and nonprofit organizations also have a board, they are not required to.
